The Open Source Retro Emulation Frontend for the Web

NOTE: At this time I am unable to create templates for platforms other than megadrive, gamegear, n64, nes, and snes. If you would like to help add more templates, feel free to create a pull request.

## Credits

The template files are modified versions of files from the emulatorjs.org code editor.
