The Open Source Retro Emulation Frontend for the Web

NOTE: At this time I am unable to create templates for platforms other than megadrive, gamegear, n64, nes, snes, and flash. If you would like to help add more templates, feel free to create a pull request.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12

## Credits

The template files for everything except Flash are modified versions of files from the emulatorjs.org code editor.

Flash emulation powered by Ruffle.

All other systems use EmulatorJS.
