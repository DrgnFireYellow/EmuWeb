# EmuWeb

The Open Source Retro Emulation Frontend for the Web

NOTE: At this time I am unable to create templates for platforms other than megadrive, n64, nes, and snes. If you would like to help add more templates, feel free to create a pull request.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12

## Setup

1. Clone the repository from GitHub or download and extract the zip.
2. Add your legally obtained roms to the games folder in the sub-folder for the appropriate system.
3. (Optional) Add game artwork (such as box art) to the artwork folder in png format named as [rom name].png. For example, if I had a rom called SuperMario64.z64 I would name my artwork file SuperMario64.z64.png.
4. Run main.py.
5. Start any web server in the output folder.
6. Open your web browser and connect to the web server.

The template files are modified versions of files from the emulatorjs.org code editor.
