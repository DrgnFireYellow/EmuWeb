# What is EmuWeb?
EmuWeb is an open source web-based retro emulation platform. This means it is a tool that can display and run your entire library of retro games in a web browser. It currently supports Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, Sega Megadrive/Genesis, Sega Game Gear, and Adobe Flash games. At the moment it can display artwork, but you have to import it manually. EmuWeb can be installed through docker or as a standalone program.
