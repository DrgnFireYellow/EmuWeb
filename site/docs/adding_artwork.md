# Adding Artwork

Once again navigate to the folder where you either cloned or extracted EmuWeb, but this time open the artwork folder. Place the artwork for your games in png format in this folder named \{your rom name\}.png. For example, if I had a rom for Super Mario 64 called SuperMario64.z64 I would name the artwork for that rom SuperMario64.z64. Finally, restart the docker container or re-run main.py to apply your changes.
